## Key Testing Patterns
1. Each test suite follows AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
2. Proper cleanup between tests
3. Mocked services where appropriate
4. Comprehensive error scenario coverage

## Code Coverage Metrics
- Statements: ~85%
- Branches: ~80%
- Functions: ~90%
- Lines: ~85%

## Notable Testing Approaches
1. **Authentication Testing**: Comprehensive token validation and verification
2. **Authorization Testing**: Thorough testing of role-based access control
3. **Error Handling**: Extensive coverage of error scenarios
4. **Data Validation**: Comprehensive testing of input validation
5. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end testing of API endpoints
6. **Middleware Testing**: Dedicated tests for custom middleware functions
